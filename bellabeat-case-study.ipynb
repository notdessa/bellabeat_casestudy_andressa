Sršen used her background as an aist to develop beautifully designed technology that informs and inspires women around the world. Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits. Since it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women.\n\n## ASK - Business challenge\n\n> How can Bellabeat find more opportunities to grow by analyzing smart device usage data to understand how to improve their health and wellness.\n\nThe key stakeholders include:\n\n- **Urška Sršen**: Chief Creative Officer and Bellabeat’s Co-founder.\n- **Sando Mur**: Mathematician and Bellabeat’s Co-founder.\n- **Bellabeat’s marketing analytics team**: a team of data analysts.\n\n### Data Sources\n- **FitBit Fitness Tracker Data**: [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) by Arash Nic (CC0 Public Domain). Accessed May 2025.\n\n## PREPARE\n- The data is long format with ID and DATE variables making it easy for merging multiple datasets to create a wide format data .\n- The data fall into the  **Reliable**, **Original**, **Comprehensible**, **Cited** but it’s not **Current** not passing at the ROCCC checklist. The data is from 2016 and not uptodate with todays technology advances (2025).\n- The datasets were verified to be public domain. I checked sources making sure I got the raw original data. The fields from the dataset has relevant data that helps understand the usage of smart devices and its relevance. \n- And finally, there was no problems detected on the data.\n\n## PROCESS\n-  I used Google Sheets for an overall view of the data, I find it faster to check column names and gross possible problems. Then used R for cleaning, preparing and visualization.\n- Ensured your datas integrity by making copies when making any manipulation and double checking number of columns and rows whenever modifying it.\n-   Checked for unique IDs, Na values in key columns, duplicates and transformed date format to make it uniform, converted the data to lowercase with underscores and removed special characters.\n-   Verified that the data is clean and ready to analyze by checking data’s summanry with commands like: `head(dataframe)`, `str(dataframe)` and `glimpse(dataframe)`.\n-   The cleaning process is also documented as comments as I code in order to review and share my results.\n\nFor this case Im working with the following dataframes:\n\n-   *dailyActivity_merged.csv*\n-   *dailyCalories_merged.csv*\n-   *dailyIntensities_merged.csv*\n-   *dailySteps_merged.csv*\n-   *sleepDay_merged.csv*\n\nUsing sheets, I removed duplicates. *sleepDay_merged.csv* had 3 duplicates. Also renamed the columns names and checked for whitespaces to facilitate further coding with R.\n\n##### Loading relevant libraries.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)\nlibrary(tidyverse)    # For data manipulation and visualization\nlibrary(janitor)      # For data cleaning functions\nlibrary(dplyr)        # For data manipulation functions\nlibrary(lubridate)    #For parse dates\nlibrary(ggplot2)      #For viz\nlibrary(tidyr)        #For cleaning and preparing data\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-03T16:54:59.973353Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-03T16:54:59.976418Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-03T16:55:01.607180Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-03T16:55:01.605341Z"},"_kg_hide-output":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"##### Created copies of the raw data, unified the naming system, cleaning names and loaded into R","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"daily_activity <- read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/fitabase-data-copies/Copy_dailyActivity_merged.csv\") %>% clean_names()\ndaily_calories <- read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/fitabase-data-copies/Copy_dailyCalories_merged.csv\") %>% clean_names()\ndaily_intensitie <- read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/fitabase-data-copies/Copy_dailyIntensities_merged.csv\") %>% clean_names()\ndaily_steps <- read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/fitabase-data-copies/Copy_dailySteps_merged.csv\") %>% clean_names()\ndaily_sleep <- read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/fitabase-data-copies/Copy_sleepDay_merged.csv\") %>% clean_names()\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-03T17:05:49.963013Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-03T17:05:49.964862Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-03T17:05:50.403156Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-03T17:05:50.393031Z"},"_kg_hide-output":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## ANALYZE\n##### Checking unique participants for each dataset","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"n_distinct(daily_activity$id)\nn_distinct(daily_calories$id)\nn_distinct(daily_intensitie$id)\nn_distinct(daily_steps$id)\nn_distinct(daily_sleep$id)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-03T17:06:14.932625Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-03T17:06:14.934480Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-03T17:06:14.980850Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-03T17:06:14.978039Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Important insight\nNot every participant responded daily sleep.The difference in participant counts between your sleep dataset (24 users) and other datasets (33 users) is significant and worth exploring.
